This form accesses the command line in order to show host output to
you. Doing so is very dangerous and results in a command execution
vulneraility. Try putting a semicolon at the beginning of your input
and running system commands. You will see the output is piped onto
the page. Try looking around for `templates/inconspicuous_file.txt`.
Inside you'll find the key.
