On the site you will find an admin login form. You will realize when
interacting with the form that it is vulnerable to SQLi. The SQLite
query in the backend is:
`SELECT true FROM Users WHERE username="admin" AND password="p@$$w0rd";`
Since you only have the password form (since this is an admin-specific
login), you can try the following OR based SQLi:
`SELECT true FROM Users WHERE username="admin" AND password="" OR 1 = 1 ;--";
---------------------------------------------injected code---^^^^^^^^^^^^^^--

This will bypass the admin login and you will be given the page with the key.

Note: you can also get the key via directory traversal
by going to `localhost:5001/admin`.
