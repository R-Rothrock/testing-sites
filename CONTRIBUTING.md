Anyone who has an idea for a level, please send a pull request and I'll review
it as soon as I can. It would be much appreciated.

Additionally, I've noticed a problem where `level1` and `level2` can be
bypassed by dev tools. I don't know very much _HTML_ and I hardly know
_Javascript_, but feel free to send a pull request if you think you can tackle
this problem. If you do send a pull request, do a separate pull request for
each level you'd be changing.

Feel free to send pull requests and issues at your leisure. Thanks in advance!
