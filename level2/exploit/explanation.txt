This site has a very rudimentary XSS vulnerability, like the previous level,
except for one difference; this one is stored XSS, not reflected XSS.
On the comments page, there is a link that goes to a page where you can add your
own comments. In the form at that site, use the following payload (the same one
as the last level):
<script>alert(key);</script>
Then go back to the previous page where your stored XSS will repeat the key
back to you.
